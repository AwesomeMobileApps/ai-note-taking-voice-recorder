    <h1>Hermit Weekend Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 9, 2023</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Hermit Weekend values your privacy. The app collects no personal information beyond what's necessary for iCloud syncing of your notes.</p>
    
    <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>We request microphone access to record and transcribe your voice notes. Audio is processed on-device and not sent to any servers. Transcription is performed using Apple's built-in speech recognition services.</p>
    
    <h2>iCloud Storage</h2>
    <p>Notes created within the app can be stored in your personal iCloud account for syncing between devices. Your note data remains private and is only accessible by you through your Apple ID. iCloud syncing is optional and can be disabled in the app settings.</p>
    
    <h2>Apple Watch Usage</h2>
    <p>The Apple Watch companion app uses the same privacy standards as the iPhone app. Voice recordings from the Watch are only used for transcription and are not stored or transmitted beyond what's required for syncing with the iPhone app.</p>
    
    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We collect anonymous usage data to improve app functionality. This data cannot be used to identify individual users and includes information such as feature usage and app performance metrics.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your notes are stored on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled). They remain there until you choose to delete them. We do not retain copies of your notes on any servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Hermit Weekend uses Apple's speech recognition services for transcription. Your use of these services is subject to Apple's privacy policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the app accordingly.</p>
